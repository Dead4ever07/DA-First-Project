<h1 align="center">Route Searching Algorithm - DA</h1>
<hr>
<p>This project consists in calculating the best route in a weighted graph taking in account a variety of restrictions</p>

### Executing the project:
To be able to create a user-friendly menu we use some properties available in the Linux terminal that are not available in the Client terminal, therefore while running the project verify if the option "Emulate terminal in the output console" or run the executable in the relative path <root-repository>/cmake-build-debug/Project.

### The Custom Dataset option:

The Locations and the Distances are separated in two folders inside of resources. In each one of those folders there are 3 files, the Distances.csv and Locations.csv are the big dataset given by the Course, the SmallDistances.csv and SmallLocations.csv are from the small dataset given as an example, the CustomDistances.csv and CustomLocations.csv are there in case the teacher wants to test a different dataset.

### Menu Controllers: 
 To use the Menu and select the option you want you need to use the arrow up/down keys and to confirm you press enter.
 If you want to return from any page either there's a return option or you can press the enter the option to quit is available at any part of
 the menu by choosing the option QUIT or pressing Q.
